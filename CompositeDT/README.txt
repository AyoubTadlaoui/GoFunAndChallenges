Certainly! Here are some theoretical exercises to help you practice composite data types (arrays, slices, maps, and structs) in Go:

1. **Arrays**:
   - Define an array of integers and print each element.
   - Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
   - Find the maximum and minimum values in an array.

2. **Slices**:
   - Create a slice of strings and append new elements to it.
   - Slice an existing slice to create a subset.
   - Use `make` to create a slice with a specific length and capacity.
   - Iterate over a slice and print each element.

3. **Maps**:
   - Create a map to store the population of different cities.
   - Add new cities and their populations to the map.
   - Retrieve the population of a specific city from the map.
   - Iterate over the map and print each key-value pair.

4. **Structs**:
   - Define a struct representing a person with fields like name, age, and email.
   - Create instances of the person struct and print their details.
   - Define methods on the person struct to update its fields.
   - Use nested structs to represent more complex data, like a person's address.

5. **Composite Data Types Integration**:
   - Create a struct to represent a book with fields like title, author, and publication year.
   - Define a map where the keys are book titles and the values are pointers to book structs.
   - Implement functions to add new books to the map, retrieve book details, and update book information.
   - Utilize slices to represent a collection of books, allowing for operations like sorting or filtering by author.

6. **Real-world Application**:
   - Design a program to manage a library with books and their availability.
   - Use structs to represent books and borrowers, and maps to store the library's inventory.
   - Implement functions to add new books, lend books to borrowers, and track book availability.

These exercises should help you solidify your understanding of composite data types and their usage in Go. Feel free to modify or extend them to fit your learning goals and interests!
