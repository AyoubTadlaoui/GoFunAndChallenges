Breefing.go Algorithms and mechanisms:

1. **Packages and Imports**:
   - The code uses the `fmt`, `os`, and `time` packages. `fmt` is used for printing, `os` for file operations, and `time` for time-related operations.

2. **Variables and Constants**:
   - The code defines a constant `logsFile` to specify the filename for storing session logs.
   - Variables like `lastSessionTime`, `amORpm`, `greet`, `now`, and `formattedTime` are used to store session-related data.

3. **Functions**:
   - The code defines several functions:
     - `Greetings`: Main function for displaying greetings and managing session logs.
     - `isNewSession`: Checks if it's a new session based on the last session time.
     - `printLastSession`: Prints the last session information if it's not a new session.
     - `readLastSessionTime`: Reads the last session time from the log file.
     - `writeLastSessionTime`: Writes the current session time to the log file.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The code handles potential errors in file operations and time parsing using error return values.
   - It uses `fmt.Errorf` to create descriptive error messages.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time-related functions like `time.Now()` are used to get the current time.
   - The `time.Since()` function calculates the time difference between timestamps.
   - `time.Format()` is used to format time strings.

6. **File Operations**:
   - The code reads from and writes to a file (`logs.txt`) to store the last session time.
   - It uses `os.Open()` and `os.Create()` to open and create files, respectively.
   - File operations are wrapped in `defer` statements to ensure files are closed properly.

7. **String Formatting**:
   - The `fmt.Fprintf()` function is used to write formatted strings to a file.

8. **Data Parsing**:
   - The code parses time data from strings using `time.Parse()`.

9. **Conditional Statements**:
   - The code uses `if` statements to conditionally execute code based on whether it's a new session or not.

10. **Looping**:
    - Although not explicitly present in this code, looping constructs like `for` or `range` could be used in similar applications.

11. **Scope**:
    - The code demonstrates the usage of package-level variables and function scope.

These are the key coding principles, concepts, and algorithms utilized in the provided Go code.
