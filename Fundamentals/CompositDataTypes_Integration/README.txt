5. **Composite Data Types Integration**:
   - Create a struct to represent a book with fields like title, author, and publication year.
   - Define a map where the keys are book titles and the values are pointers to book structs.
   - Implement functions to add new books to the map, retrieve book details, and update book information.
   - Utilize slices to represent a collection of books, allowing for operations like sorting or filtering by author.
