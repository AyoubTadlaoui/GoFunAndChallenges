git clone https://github.com/AyoubTadlaoui/LearningGo.git
```

## Usage

The LearningGo project contains various directories and files, each focusing on a specific aspect of Go programming. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in each directory:

- **Fundamentals**: Contains examples and tutorials covering the basic concepts of Go programming, including variables, functions, control flow, data structures, and more.
- **Challenges**: Offers a collection of coding challenges designed to test your understanding of Go fundamentals and improve your problem-solving skills.
- **Advanced**: Explores advanced topics in Go programming, such as concurrency, error handling, packages, and more.

Feel free to explore the directories and files in this repository to learn more about Go programming.

â””â”€â”€ main.go

## How To lunch your Programs:
Go to Fundamentals Directory into main.go
Uncomment the Imported directory and its function for exemple, you want to work with Arrays uncomment Path that ends with Arrays
then in the Function uncomment its package module. as you can see below.
import (

arrayconst "LearningGO/Fundamentals/Arrays"
	"fmt"
)

func Fundamentals() {

	fmt.Println("================== Fundamentals ===================")

 arrayconst.Arrays()

}

When you finish with your section make sure you Comment-out the path first then the function before you save the file
